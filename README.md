# Socket Programming in C/C++

### In C++, socket programming is a method that combines two or more nodes with each other over a network so that the nodes can share the data without any loss of the data. In this connection, one node listens to one port which is connected to a particular IP address. When the client reaches the server, the server creates the socket listener.
