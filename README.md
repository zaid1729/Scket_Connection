# Socket Programming in C/C++

In C++, socket programming is a method that combines two or more nodes with each other over a network so that the nodes can share the data without any loss of the data. In this connection, one node listens to one port which is connected to a particular IP address. When the client reaches the server, the server creates the socket listener.

## What is a Socket?

The socket is a type of mechanism that is used to exchange data between different processes. Here these processes are either present in different devices or the same device which are connected over a network. Once the connection for the socket is created, then the data can be sent in both directions and continues until one of the endpoints closes the connection.
